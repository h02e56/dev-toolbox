My Scaffolders
==============

This repository is to store and track my application, configurations or whatever types of scaffolders that I use.


## Description

This repository is for my personal use, you can use, but I don't expect to publish in any package manager because I don't think that it is a package for a common use.

Any contribution is accepted if it fulfills with my own expectations.

Each scaffolder is stored into a directorie and/or subdirectorie.
